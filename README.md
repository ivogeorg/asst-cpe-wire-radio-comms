#### 7. Demo video

1. Record a 60 second video that shows:
   1. 
   2. 

2. Upload it to [Imgur](https://help.imgur.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000083326-What-files-can-I-upload-What-is-the-size-limit-).

3. Include the URL in the [Demo video](#demo-video) section of the README.

## Resources

### micro:bit 

1. [micro:bit lessons](https://makecode.microbit.org/lessons).

2. [micro:bit ideas](https://microbit.org/ideas/).

3. A list of some more [advanced projects](https://www.itpro.co.uk/desktop-hardware/26289/13-top-bbc-micro-bit-projects).

4. The [projects](https://github.com/carlosperate/awesome-microbit#%EF%B8%8F-projects) at the [awesome micro:bit list](https://github.com/carlosperate/awesome-microbit).

5. micro:bit [technical documentation](https://tech.microbit.org/).

### Github

1. Github Tutorial for Beginners ([webpage](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)).

2. Github Basics for Mac and Windows ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE)).

3. git & Github Crash Course for Beginners ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)).

4. Introduction to Github for Beginners ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQLK8Ib_SKk)).

5. About `git` ([webpage](https://git-scm.com/about)).

6. `git` [documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) (webpage, book, videos, reference manual).

7. [Github markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### JavaScript

1. Technically, the language which is used side-by-side with Blocks in the Makecode ronment is a subset of [TypeScript](https://makecode.com/language), which itself is a superset of JavaScript (technically, [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#Title)), with some JS features not implemented in Makecode.

2. The limited [JavaScript mini-tutorial](https://makecode.microbit.org/javascript) in Makecode.

3. Official [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html):
   1. TypeScript in 5 min [tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html). _Note: You will need to [download](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links) and install an integrated development environment (IDE). The two that I recommend are Visual Studio Code from Microsoft and WebStorm from JetBrains._
   2. The full documentation and reference is under _Handbook_. Bear in mind that you are drinking from the hose. Don't be surprised if not everything is presented in a strictly incremental manner.
   
4. In-browser TypeScript [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html). Note that micro:bit specific code will not run, but you can still play. _Start making the distinction between a generic multi-purpose programming language (TypeScript) and functionality (packages, libraries, objects, etc.) that is specific to a particular device (micro:bit), though written in the same programming language._

5. A pretty good and very palatable JS tutorial with in-browser coding, by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).

6. Extensive and detailed [JS tutorial](https://javascript.info/), with some advanced material thrown in. **I like this one!**

7. The most authoritative JS resource on the Web, including tutorials and reference, by [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
